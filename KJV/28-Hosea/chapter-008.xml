	<chapter num="8">
		<verse num="1">Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</verse>
		<verse num="2">Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</verse>
		<verse num="3">Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
		<verse num="4">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</verse>
		<verse num="6">For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</verse>
		<verse num="9">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</verse>
		<verse num="10">Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</verse>
		<verse num="12">I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</verse>
		<verse num="13">They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</verse>
