		<verse num="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
		<verse num="2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</verse>
		<verse num="3">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</verse>
		<verse num="4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
		<verse num="5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
		<verse num="6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</verse>
		<verse num="7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</verse>
		<verse num="9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</verse>
		<verse num="10">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</verse>
		<verse num="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</verse>
		<verse num="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
		<verse num="17">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</verse>
		<verse num="18">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</verse>
		<verse num="19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
		<verse num="20">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</verse>
		<verse num="21">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</verse>
		<verse num="22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</verse>
		<verse num="23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
