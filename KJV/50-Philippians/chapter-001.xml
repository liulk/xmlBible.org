		<verse num="1">Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</verse>
		<verse num="2">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</verse>
		<verse num="4">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</verse>
		<verse num="5">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</verse>
		<verse num="6">Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</verse>
		<verse num="7">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</verse>
		<verse num="8">For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</verse>
		<verse num="10">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.</verse>
		<verse num="11">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
		<verse num="12">But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</verse>
		<verse num="13">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</verse>
		<verse num="14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
		<verse num="15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</verse>
		<verse num="16">The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</verse>
		<verse num="17">But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</verse>
		<verse num="18">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</verse>
		<verse num="19">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
		<verse num="20">According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</verse>
		<verse num="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
		<verse num="22">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</verse>
		<verse num="23">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</verse>
		<verse num="24">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</verse>
		<verse num="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</verse>
		<verse num="26">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</verse>
		<verse num="27">Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</verse>
		<verse num="28">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</verse>
		<verse num="29">For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</verse>
		<verse num="30">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
