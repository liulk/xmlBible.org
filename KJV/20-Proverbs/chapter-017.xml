	<chapter num="17">
		<verse num="1">Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</verse>
		<verse num="2">A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</verse>
		<verse num="3">The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</verse>
		<verse num="4">A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</verse>
		<verse num="5">Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</verse>
		<verse num="6">Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.</verse>
		<verse num="7">Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</verse>
		<verse num="8">A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</verse>
		<verse num="9">He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.</verse>
		<verse num="10">A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</verse>
		<verse num="11">An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</verse>
		<verse num="12">Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</verse>
		<verse num="13">Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</verse>
		<verse num="14">The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</verse>
		<verse num="15">He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.</verse>
		<verse num="16">Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?</verse>
		<verse num="17">A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</verse>
		<verse num="18">A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</verse>
		<verse num="19">He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</verse>
		<verse num="20">He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</verse>
		<verse num="21">He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</verse>
		<verse num="22">A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</verse>
		<verse num="23">A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</verse>
		<verse num="24">Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</verse>
		<verse num="25">A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</verse>
		<verse num="26">Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</verse>
		<verse num="27">He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</verse>
		<verse num="28">Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.</verse>
