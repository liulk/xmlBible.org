		<verse num="1">Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
		<verse num="2">And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</verse>
		<verse num="3">And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</verse>
		<verse num="4">And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</verse>
		<verse num="5">And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</verse>

		<verse num="7">And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</verse>
		<verse num="8">Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</verse>
		<verse num="9">Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</verse>
		<verse num="10">He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</verse>

		<verse num="16">And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</verse>
		<verse num="17">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</verse>
